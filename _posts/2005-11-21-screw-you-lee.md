[Lee Corso](http://bios.espn.com/talent/lee_corso) actually believes that [USF](http://gobulls.usf.edu/Sports/main.asp) will beat [WVU](http://www.msnsports.net) on December 3, 2005. Assuming we beat [Pitt](http://pittsburghpanthers.collegesports.com/) on Thursday night and [USF](http://gobulls.usf.edu/Sports/main.asp) beats [UConn](http://uconnhuskies.com/) this week, this would mean that [USF](http://gobulls.usf.edu/Sports/main.asp) would be tied with us for the Big East Championship, and would go to the Big East’s BCS bowl.

I hope when all of these “impartial” sports analysts/announcers see us in the Sugar Bowl we get an apology, or they atleast admit they were wrong. My guess is it won’t be that [WVU](http://www.msnsports.net) did good this season and deserves to be there, all we’ll hear is how [USF](http://gobulls.usf.edu/Sports/main.asp), [Louisville](http://uoflsports.collegesports.com/), and [Pitt](http://pittsburghpanthers.collegesports.com/) blew there games against us.

On a brighter note, [WVU](http://www.msnsports.net) has moved up to [\#12 in both polls](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankingsindex). We’ll see where we are when the new BCS Poll comes out later this afternoon. My guess is 10 or 11.

[WVU](http://www.msnsports.net) Men’s Basketball plays [Texas](http://www.texassports.com/) in the semi-finals of the [Guardians Classic](http://www.guardiansclassic.com/) tonight at 7:00 EST. It will be on ESPN2.
