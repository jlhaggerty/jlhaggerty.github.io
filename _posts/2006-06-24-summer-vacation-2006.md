Treah and I have spent the last week on our “Summer Vacation.” Treah finished up her 3rd year of med school and only has 2 weeks off before her 4th year starts. We thought that we’d travel and go see some family we don’t get to see very often. Treah’s parents came up on Friday, June 16th. This was her birthday. They stayed through Wednesday to do some work on the house and to [dog sit](http://busydingbat.wordpress.com/2006/06/22/our-grandbaby/) for us. When they left Wednesday they dropped her off at the kennel for us.

We left Morgantown, WV on Sunday, June 18th and drove 8 hours up to [Herkimer, NY](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=herkimer,+ny&ie=UTF8&om=1). Treah’s grandparents, aunts and uncles, and cousins live there. This is the town her Dad grew up in. While in NY we:

- Went on a boat tour of the [Erie Canal](http://www.canals.state.ny.us/exvac/landwater/lwerie.html)
- Went on a geocache
- Did some home work
- Did a lot of visiting with family

We stayed in NY until Wednesday afternoon, and then drove the 4.5 hours over to [Williston, VT](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=williston,+vt&ie=UTF8&om=1). This is the general area where most of my side of the family lives. Since being in VT we have:

5. Found a geocache
6. Planted a new geocache
7. Gone to the [Chew Chew Festival](http://www.greenmountainchewchew.com/) on the lake front of Burlington. This was a food festival. A bunch of the restaurants from Burlington came and set up tents. Everyone bought tokens and traded the tokens for food. [Ben and Jerry’s](http://www.benjerry.com/) was there and introduced there new ready made milkshakes. They were pretty good, but I don’t see myself buying any of them
8. Went to my parent’s company picnic at [Button Bay State Park](http://www.vtstateparks.com/htm/buttonbay.cfm)
9. Went to a horse show at my Aunt’s horse farm. This was the first one I had been to. I was kind of lost at first, but luckily my cousin Molly was there explaining everything to me. She competed for years until she went to college. While at the farm, we went and saw the two new baby horses. It was interesting to see the similarities in a baby horse and a puppy.
Overall, it’s been a busy and fun week. I can’t believe all we have done. We’re heading home tomorrow, and I’m really not looking forward to the 12 hour car ride we’ve got in front of us. Oh well, I have to be back at work Monday morning. Check out [Treah’s Blog](http://www.treah.com/), she has some pictures up of the trip.
