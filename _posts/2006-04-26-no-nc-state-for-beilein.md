Ever since WVU made it to the elite 8 last season, every college basketball coaching position opened has had John Beilein’s name on it. Coach has always avoided any questions about any possible moves. I was never that worried until today.

Today it was announced that he was the leading candidate for the head coaching position at NC State. As usual he refused to comment on it. Every news story about it said it was a sure thing, and that there was nothing that WVU could do. Then this afternoon the 2nd candidate withdrew his name from the running. Needless to say I was starting to come to terms that WVU was losing there coach.

This totally ruined my day. I have been moping around all day.

I decided to tune in to the WV State Wide Sportsline radio show. This show is basically a weekly radio show about WV sports. Coach Rod and Coach Beilein are regulars on this show. I didn’t think he would be on tonight, but thought I’d at least hear what everyone thought about the situation. About 20 minutes into the show they received an official statement from Coach Beilein. He’s NOT going anywhere! Here’s a link to the statement:

I’m glad he’s staying, at least for next season. I hope he decides to finish his career here at WVU.
