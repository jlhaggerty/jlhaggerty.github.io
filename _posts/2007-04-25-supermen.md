This time of year is bland for me. There’s no sports that I really follow going on. I don’t follow much hockey or baseball. Watching an NBA game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth from seeing people WVU played make millions, while former Mountaineers are in Europe or on farm league teams. I’m definitely not into NASCAR (is that really a sport?).

The thing that keeps me going is the build up and hype of the up coming Mountaineer football season. I can’t get enough of it.

You Tube has also helped over the last couple of years. Speaking of You Tube, here’s a movie to hold you over:
