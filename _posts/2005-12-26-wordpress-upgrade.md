I am working on a WordPress upgrade. I don’t think it will take very long, but things may look a bit hairy until it is done.

\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*  
The Upgrade went flawless. I’m now running WordPress version 2.0. If you’re looking to upgrade I followed this guide:  
[http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading\_WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress)

It probably took about 10 minutes to upgrade, including making all of my backups.
