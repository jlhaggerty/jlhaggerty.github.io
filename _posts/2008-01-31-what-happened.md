Last night I witnessed the worst WVU basketball in my lifetime. WVU lost 62-39, at home!! WVU hasn’t scored less than 40 points since [February 6, 1980](http://www.wvustats.com/mbasketball/box_score.php?team_id=308&game_id=1615). This was the 2nd lowest scoring game for WVU at the Coliseum. According to [the box score](http://www.wvustats.com/mbasketball/box_score.php?team_id=308&game_id=42977) we only made 11 shots. We were 10/50 from the field, and 1/22 from the 3 point line. If we had not gone 18/24 from the free throw line (10/10 from Nichols alone), we would have been ever worse off. I’m not not sure what was wrong, but I hope we can shake it off and get back to playing ball like I know we can.

If any good game out of the game it is that coach Huggins got a new gold suit. This man has quite the sense of style.  
 <style type="text/css">
			#gallery-3 {
				margin: auto;
			}
			#gallery-3 .gallery-item {
				float: left;
				margin-top: 10px;
				text-align: center;
				width: 100%;
			}
			#gallery-3 img {
				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;
			}
			#gallery-3 .gallery-caption {
				margin-left: 0;
			}
			/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */
		</style>
