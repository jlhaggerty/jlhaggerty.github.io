Well WVU did it again. We knocked off UCLA. This is the the 2nd time in a row. UCLA came into the coliseum yesterday ranked #2 in the country. This was the 4th time WVU and UCLA has played. WVU leads the series 3-1. I have a feeling we won’t be playing UCLA again anytime soon.

Anyway, In the above picture can you find the hidden Mountaineer? I’ll give you a clue. [Joe Mazzulla](http://msnsports.net/profile.cfm?id=101266&sport=mbball) is in there some where.
