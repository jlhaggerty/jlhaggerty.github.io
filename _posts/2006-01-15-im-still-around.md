Believe it or not I’m still alive and kicking. It’s been over 2 weeks since my last post. Anyway, I’ll try to keep up. So what’s new with me?

As of January 1st, my job title at work changed to Senior System Administrator. Along with this came a hefty raise and an increase of vacation accrual rate. I now accrue 24 days of vacation a year.

I have been pretty tied up at work ironing out problems with our WebCT Vista install and our F5 BigIP Load balancers. Again people didn’t test everything they should have when the systems were implemented so it meant a crisis situation for me. Got to love incompetence. I have one more problem to figure out this week and I should be done with this.

It has been a great time to be a Mountaineer fan over the last couple weeks. WVU football won the Sugar Bowl. This is the first bowl win under Coach Rod. It’s also the first BCS win in school history. We ended the season with a #5 ranking. Slaton rushed for 1128 as a true freshman and White rushed for 952 as a red shirt freshman, I see a bright future in Morgantown. WVU Men’s Basketball is doing great too. We’re now ranked #16, and have beat two top 10 teams in the last 2 weeks, both on the road. We are on a 10 game winning streak, making our record 12-3, 4-0 in the Big East. This puts us in 1st place in the Big East. Yesterday WVU broke a school record and made 20 3 point shots (60 points!) in a single game. 8 of those came from Mike Gansey (tying a school record), he ended the night with a career best 33 points. Kevin Pittsnogle added 30 points, with 4 3’s. I think we’ll be around #12 when the new poll comes out this week. On a side note Pitt is one of the 3 teams in the nation that is still undefeated. They’re playing Louisville today and Louisville is up at the start of the 2nd half. Keep your fingers crossed that the Cards hand Pitt there first loss. Another side note is that 6 Big East teams are in the top 25.

The weather in Morgantown has been crazy lately. I think we hit 70 degrees on Friday, then I woke up to snow on Saturday.

I think that’s it for now. Stay tuned for my next post as to why best buy has made there way onto my walmart list.
