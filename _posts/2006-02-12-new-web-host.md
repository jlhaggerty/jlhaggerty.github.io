Well I did it. I’ve been telling support for months that if things didn’t change that I was moving to a new host. They didn’t seem to believe me. So tonight I signed on with some one new. My current host has been nothing but trouble since I registered. The constant outages, high loads, and unannounced system changes pushed me over the edge.

I still have a couple of months left on my contract with my current host. So I am going to try and get all of my content migrated before I change the DNS entries for thehaggertys.net. Regardless, there might be some time where my pages won’t load while the DNS changes make there way out to everyone on the web.

My new host gave me a free domain name. So I registered [www.treah.com](http://www.treah.com) for my wife. It was the deal maker. She didn’t want me to spend the money until I told her she’d have her own domain name. So I’ll be migrating her blog over to it.

I’d just like to close with a strong word of warning for anyone who is considering using [Web Hosting Buzz](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/) as a web host. The prices are cheap, but you get what you pay for. Stay away!
