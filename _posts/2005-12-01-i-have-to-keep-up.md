One of the things I wanted to make sure I didn’t do when I started this blog was to let it get outdated like several of my old websites eventually did. My wife pointed out to me today that I hadn’t put anything up since last Friday, almost a week ago. So I’m here updating this page.

So, what’s happened in the last week.

1. WVU Football won the Big East Championship and the BCS spot.
2. WVU Basketball dropped out of the top 25, but won again Wednesday night despite a 21-0 run by St. Bonaventure. We’re now 3-3, all of our losses are against top 25 teams.
3. Interviews have finally been scheduled for the Senior Systems Administrator position that I applied for back in mid September. I have a phone interview on December 5th.
4. I was lucky enough to get to go into work at 5:30am on Tuesday due to some incompetent application testing.
5. Found out we’re placing a $1.6 million order to IBM at work. We’re getting a P590, a blade center (maybe), upgrading our P650, and some services to help set everything up. Merry Christmas Rod!
6. I’m learning a lot about our load balancer. It’s mostly been sink or swim.
7. I found a video of this guy: <http://www.break.com/articles/whatslove.html>

My football picks for this weekend: Fresno State, WVU, Florida State, USC, LSU, Texas, and Louisville.
