As you know by now WVU won the NIT this season. You might not remember how they got there. We beat MIssissippi State in the semi-final round. We won on a buzzer beater 3 pointer by Darris Nichols.

I came across this video of the shot on youtube. It was taken from some one in the stands at the game, I assume with a cell phone. I think it better shows the environment after the shot than anything ESPN showed.
