I knew it was going to happen. I got Treah’s cold. I guess karma caught up with me. I cracked a lot of jokes when Treah had it about her being sick.

Anyway, I have a soar throat, my nose seems to switch randomly from being stuffed up to constantly running, and my ears feel like they need to be popped. Throw in a cough here and there, and a couple sneezes, and you’ve got my weekend.

One benefit of being a state employee is that I accrue 11.5 hours of sick leave a month. I have 300+ hours of sick leave to take. I think that should cover this sickness.
