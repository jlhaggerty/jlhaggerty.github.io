WVU is having a free [“e-cycling”](http://wecan.wvu.edu/wvu_e_cycling_day_april_16th) event tomorrow. They’re only asking for 1 canned food item per item you bring in. I plan on taking full advantage of this event. I just got done loading up my jeep with all of my old computer and electronics. It only took me about 2 hours to do it. Here’s the end result:  
 <style type="text/css">
			#gallery-5 {
				margin: auto;
			}
			#gallery-5 .gallery-item {
				float: left;
				margin-top: 10px;
				text-align: center;
				width: 100%;
			}
			#gallery-5 img {
				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;
			}
			#gallery-5 .gallery-caption {
				margin-left: 0;
			}
			/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */
		</style>

<div class="gallery galleryid-190 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-5"><dl class="gallery-item"> <dt class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![](https://justin.thehaggertys.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ecycle-300x200.jpg)](https://justin.thehaggertys.net/ecycle/ecycle/) </dt></dl>  
 </div>I don’t think the picture does it justice so here’s a list of what I got rid of:

- 9 desktop pc’s
- 3 CRT monitors
- 3 Printers
- 2 Stereos
- 5 Keyboards
- 2 Sets of computer speakers
- 2 Pairs of stereo speakers

Now I just have to find room to put 26 cans of food.
