I was listening to my ipod today while I was running some new coax cable (more on this later). As usual I had it on set to shuffle. After about 15 minutes, Blink 182’s “Stay Together for the Kids” came up. Given my family’s current situation it seemed eerily fitting.

Lyrics:  
It’s hard to wake up  
When the shades have been pulled shut  
This house is haunted  
It’s so pathetic  
It makes no sense at all.  
I’m ripe with things to say  
The words rot and fall away.  
If a stupid poem could fix this home  
I’d read it every day.

So here’s your holiday  
Hope you enjoy it this time  
You gave it all away  
It was mine  
So when you’re dead and gone  
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost.  
It’s not right

Their anger hurts my ears  
Been running strong for seven years  
Rather than fix the problems, they never solve them  
It makes no sense at all  
I see them every day  
We get along so why can’t they?  
If this is what he wants and this is what  
she wants  
Then why is there so much pain?

So here’s your holiday  
Hope you enjoy it this time  
You gave it all away  
It was mine  
So when you’re dead and gone  
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost  
It’s not right

So here’s your holiday  
Hope you enjoy it this time  
You gave it all away  
It was mine  
So when you’re dead and gone  
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost  
It’s not right.
