By now I’m sure most of you know about [google maps](http://maps.google.com). Some one on the [blue gold news](http://www.bluegoldnews.com/) forums told everyone to check out Alltel Stadium. This is in Jacksonville, FL and is the home of the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars.

Here’s what you see if you look up the stadium in google maps:

This was the game Treah and I went to with the rest of the Boyer crew. Pretty interesting.

Here’s some pics from our trip: [Gator Bowl Pics](http://gallery.thehaggertys.net/main.php?g2_itemId=1876)
