Last night was WVU’s first home night game of the season. If you haven’t been to a night game at Mountaineer Field it is something I highly suggest. The atmosphere and energy in the place is so much different. I believe we are undefeated under Coach Rod in night games at Mountaineer field.

The Mountaineers definitely didn’t disappoint anyone and kept our streak alive. WVU rolled over Maryland 45-24, and had 28 points in the 1st quarter.

Steve Slaton had 149 yards in the 1st quarter. He ended the night with 195 yards and 2 touchdowns. At one point in the 4th quarter he was over 200 yards, but then had a couple negative yard plays. His performance put him in the lead for the [most rushing yards in the country](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/sortables?stat=rush&sort=rushyds&season=2&year=2006&group=80) with 503 yards in 3 games. ESPN is now projecting that he will have [over 2000 yards](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174468) by the end of the season. He is also ranked [3rd in the country in scoring](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/sortables?stat=score&sort=pts&season=2&year=2006&group=80). All this and he is only a true sophomore (no redshirt).

Maryland had the chance to have Steve Slaton on there team. They offered him a scholarship, he committed to play football there, and they pulled the offer later on. The coach said they had to many running backs. The guy he picked in Steve’s spot has now flunked out of school. Big mistake.

Maryland also had the chance to have our big full back Owen Schmitt. He spent a year at a Division III school. At the end of that season he decided he was good enough for Division IA. He made a highlight film and sent it out to schools. Maryland told him to spend 2 years in a Junior College and they’d take him in his senior season. Owen declined and decided to come the WVU.

The series record between WVU and Maryland is 27-26 with WVU having the lead after last night. Maryland backed out of the contract with WVU for the next 2 seasons claiming that it wasn’t in the program’s best interest to play us in the next 2 years. Supposedly we’ll be playing them again in 2010. I don’t trust anything an ACC school says. So I’ll believe it when I see it.

A couple bad spots on the night were that we had 95 yards in penalties called against us and our defense seemed out of it. They allowed 333 total yards and 211 of that was from passing. Our passing defense really needs to step it up a notch. At one point I noticed that Maryland ran the same pass play to the tight end 3 times in a row. Each time resulting in 5 or 6 yards. Our guys couldn’t stop it. They also scored a passing touchdown to the tight end with our closest defender being 10 yards away.

All in all it was a great night and a big win. It ended our streak of 3 home games in 12 days. Now I have to wait until October 14th before we play at home again. What will I do?
