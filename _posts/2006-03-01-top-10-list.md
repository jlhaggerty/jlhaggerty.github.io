I’ve been a big fan of David Letterman since I was old enough to actually stay up and see his show. I’m also a big fan of The Family Guy. I was one of the few that watched it back in the 90’s before fox canceled it. Anyway, I came across a mixture of the two. Here’s a video of Peter Griffin doing a top 10 list on Letterman.

 I promise this blog won’t turn into a video dump. I’ve just found a couple I couldn’t resist in the past few days. Thanks to [www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) for the bandwidth hosting the files.
