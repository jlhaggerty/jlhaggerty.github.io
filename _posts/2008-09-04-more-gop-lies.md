I came across this AP story. It basically fact checks the claims made by various people in their RNC speaches. It should come as no surprise that they lied… Again.

Looks like they’re still going to tell lies and fear monger people into voting Republican. So much for the McCain’s “Straight Talk Express.” I wish America would wake up and stop falling victim to these tactics.

In case you haven’t noticed, I’m a liberal and a registered Democrat. I find many of the things the GOP does to be morally wrong, unethical, and even just plain stupid.

The 2008 RNC has been no exception to this.
