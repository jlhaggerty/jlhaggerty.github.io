Many of you know that I play drums. Well I guess itâ€™s been long enough now that I should say that I used to play drums. One of my favorite types of drumming is marching percussion. It is how I got my start.

One of my favorite drummers is Travis Barker. I have seen Travis play about every type of popular music from rock, to rap, to punk. Well tonight I found this video clip of Travis Barker playing a marching snare drum. Pretty cool.
