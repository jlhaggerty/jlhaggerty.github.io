MIT with the help of some major computer industry players (not Microsoft) developed a $100 laptop computer. This was done with hopes to provide a laptop for every child in 3rd world and developing countries. For $100 obviously the laptop isn’t going to be the latest and greatest. However, it does have all of the essentials a person would need. It even has a wireless network chip in it so that when multiple laptops are in the area it sets up a network. Here’s the website if you want more info on the project: [http://laptop.org/index.en\_US.html  ](http://laptop.org/index.en_US.html)

Now Bill Gates is upset because the computers don’t run Windows. I believe they run a custom version of Red Hat Linux. He’s also upset that they are not running on Microsoft’s new Origami machines. These are supposed to be ultra portable desktop/tablet PC/pda hybrid machines. They have a price tag of $600-$1000 each.

So where does good old Bill decided to speak out against this project? At MIT! Bill must forget what it’s like to not have money. He forgets that a developing country can by 10 of the $100 laptops for the price of 1 of his Origami machines. It seems like a no brainer to me. Anyway, you can read more about Bill’s outcry at:
