Here’s a little pre-game hype for everyone:

In case you haven’t been keeping up. WVU Football is 2-0, [ranked #5](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankingsindex) in the country, and [Steve Slaton](http://www.msnsports.net/profile.cfm?id=101042&sport=football) is in the [top 5 for the most rushing yards](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/sortables?stat=rush&sort=rushyds&season=2&year=2006&group=80). He did this even with only 8 carries in the last game. Steve is also a Heisman candidate. We’ve got a night game in Morgantown tonight against Maryland. It’s a great time to be a Mountaineer!
