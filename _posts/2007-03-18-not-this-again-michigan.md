Yesterday the University of Michigan fired Tommy Amaker. He has been Michigan’s men’s basketball coach since 2001. Under his watch, Michigan has not made the NCAA tournament and has a 109-83 record. Not that great.

A day later, sports writers every where are talking about Coach Beilein being the perfect fit for Michigan. Mountaineer fans everywhere went through this last season. The rumors were that Coach Beilein was headed to NC State. These rumors turned out to not be true, and I couldn’t be happier.

I hope that this time Coach Beilein says right away he isn’t interested in leaving WVU. I have a gut feeling that he won’t. I don’t think he’ll leave, but I think he’ll leave his options open and not comment.

I guess this is the cost of success. WVU seems to go through this every off season in football and basketball.

Here’s a couple articles:
