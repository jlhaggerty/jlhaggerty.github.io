Last weekend I turned on the TV and Discovery was showing some show about the Everglades. The noises being played through my surround sound setup drove Vandy nuts. She kept trying to find where all of them were coming from. Then she noticed there was a big bird on the TV. I was able to rewind and get her to react again, this time I was recording it.
