Treah and I have been thinking about buying a house. Nothing serious yet, just browsing realtor websites. We did stop at 1 open house. I think the biggest hold up in my mind has been trying to figure out where are we going to be living in 3 years when Treah finishes her residency program. What happens if we have to move and sell our house? How much money will we lose/make?

Anyway, I found [this on the NY Times website](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin) today. It’s a little flash based app where you enter in what you think your rent on a place would be, what you would pay for a house, and the mortgage info. It then takes all of this information and graphs out whether it’s better financially for you to rent or buy. It shows the cost savings/costs per year.
