I had my phone interview for the Senior Sys Admin position this morning. I was asked to submit a list of references so they could do background checks, and they would be in touch. The next step is to do in person interviews. Hopefully I’ll know that I got the position by Christmas. My original goal was Thanksgiving.

I think Treah and I are mostly done with our Christmas shopping. Only a couple of presents left to buy. I am impressed that we are this close to done so early. I’m usually at the mall Christmas Eve, or sometimes even the day after Christmas.

Anyone looking to buy me something, here’s a link to my [Amazon.com wish list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/102-6026994-1772968?%5Fencoding=UTF8&type=wishlist&id=1BJMNGNNICCZR).
