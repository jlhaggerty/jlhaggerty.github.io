The semester is finally over. Now the only thing on my plate is work and Christmas. Doug and Susan made the trip up from Beckley to celebrate Christmas with Treah and I this weekend.

We went to dinner at the Texas Road House and spent Saturday night doing the traditional Christmas Eve poker game and drinking spiked egg nog. I tried to explain how to play craps, but everyone seemed to think I was making up the rules as I went along. Christopher and Deborah exchanged presents with Treah and I.

Today we exchanged presents with Doug and Susan. Doug has been spending the morning trying to get the humidifier working, so far we’ve made 2 trips to Lowe’s.

So far I’ve got some cool stuff:

- 2 disc golf discs
- Think geek shirt
- Card shuffler
- Card boot
- Visa gift card
- Lowe’s gift card
- T-square
- Laser level
- 18volt Craftsman Cordless Drill
- The Office – Season 2 DVD (BBC version)
- Multi tool
- Chocolates

Treah and I leave Thursday to make the trip to Vermont. We’ll be spending Christmas with my parents up there.
