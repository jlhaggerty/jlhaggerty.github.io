So by now most people already know the story about Governor Manchin forcing WVU into a 7 year deal to play Marshall University in football. Governor Manchin is a WVU alumnus, but you’ve got to wonder where his loyalties lie. The deal definitely isn’t good for WVU.

Over the weekend I saw this picture of him sporting Marshall green and a MU lapel pin:

It hit me the after seeing the picture. Governor Manchin must think MU stands for Manchin University. I just can’t wait until it becomes WVU Huntington Campus or Huntington Community College, take your pick.

Yes that is [Matthew McConaughey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/) with him. He decided to ruin his career by taking a role in the upcoming blockbuster flop “We are Marshall.”
