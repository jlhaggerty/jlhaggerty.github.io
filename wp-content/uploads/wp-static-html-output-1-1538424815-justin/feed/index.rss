				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I turned on the TV and Discovery was showing some show about the Everglades.  The noises being played through my surround sound setup drove Vandy nuts.  She kept trying to find where all of them were coming from.  Then she noticed there was a big bird on the TV.   I was able to rewind and get her to react again, this time I was recording it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time tomorrow I&#8217;ll be at the WVU vs Auburn Football game.  I honestly don&#8217;t know how it will turn out.  Both teams have sub par offenses and great defenses.  Both teams were ranked at the beginning of the season, and now neither are.  WVU and Auburn have never played football against each other, so we can&#8217;t look at past performance.  </p>
<p>My prediction is that if WVU&#8217;s offense can click the game won&#8217;t be close.  If they don&#8217;t click, it will be a low scoring game and a defensive battle.   </p>
<p>The game will also be a &#8220;Gold Rush.&#8221;  This is where WVU tries to get everyone to wear gold.  It does look impressive on TV.  Here&#8217;s a screen grab some one on the <a href="http://www.bluegoldnews.com" target="_blank">bluegoldnews.com</a> forums posted of last year&#8217;s Gold Rush.  I&#8217;m going to try and get a HDTV screen grab of this year&#8217;s game.<br />

<p>Here&#8217;s hoping everything goes as planned tomorrow.  After all, I did beat Auburn 84-0 on the PlayStation last week.  </p>

That doesn&#8217;t even count road side signs, billboards, bumper stickers, magazines, newspapers, etc.  All that and I don&#8217;t think we can afford 8 more years of the same old crap.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being from Vermont it seems that <a href="http://sanders.senate.gov/about/" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> is the butt of many jokes, especially in his home state.  However, I think many people would agree with the petition he is heading up to put limits on the $700 billion bailout.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
Any plan to clean up the mess on Wall Street must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that middle income and working families are not the ones who are paying for this bailout by
<ul>
<li>Imposing a five-year, 10 percent surtax on income over $1 million a year for couples and over $500,000 for single taxpayers. That would raise more than $300 billion in revenue over five years;</li>
<li>Ensuring that assets purchased from banks are realistically discounted so companies are not rewarded for their risky behavior and taxpayers can recover the amount they paid for them; and</li>
<li>Requiring that taxpayers receive equity stakes in the bailed-out companies so that the taxpayers’ assumption of risk is rewarded when companies’ stock goes up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together these three provisions will substantially reduce the likelihood that this bailout will end up on the backs of average American taxpayers.</li>
<li>Include a major economic recovery package which puts Americans to work at decent wages. Among many other areas, we can create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and moving our country from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Further, we must protect our must vulnerable families from the very difficult times they are experiencing.</li>
<li>Repeal the disastrous de-regulatory legislation that facilitated this crisis.</li>
<li>End the danger posed by companies that are “too big to fail,” that is, companies whose failure would cause systemic harm to the U.S. economy. If a company is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. We need to determine which companies fall in this category and then break them up.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If you agree with this you can sign his petition online (even if you&#8217;re not a Vermonter) at:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across this AP story.  It basically fact checks the claims made by various people in their RNC speaches.  It should come as no surprise that they lied&#8230; Again.<br />
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//ap/20080904/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_fact_check">http://news.yahoo.com/story//ap/20080904/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_fact_check</a></p>
<p>Looks like they&#8217;re still going to tell lies and fear monger people into voting Republican.  So much for the McCain&#8217;s &#8220;Straight Talk Express.&#8221;  I wish America would wake up and stop falling victim to these tactics.</p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, I&#8217;m a liberal and a registered Democrat.  I find many of the things the GOP does to be morally wrong, unethical, and even just plain stupid.</p>
<p>The 2008 RNC has been no exception to this.</p>
