I’ve decided it’s time to jump on the blog bandwagon. I’ll try to keep this updated with things going on in my life, interesting links, tech stuff, political rants, or whatever else I feel is blog worthy.

If you’re interested in setting up a blog, WordPress is simple to setup and has a ton of features. I would highly recommend them. I’m going to work on converting Treah’s blog to WordPress from blogger.

That’s all for now, I actually have to get back to work.
