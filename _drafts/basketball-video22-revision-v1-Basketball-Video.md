This video kind of sums up WVU men’s basketball since Coach Beilein came in 2002. The emphasis is mostly on what WVU did last year on there run to the elite 8, and it doesn’t have anything from the current season. I had seen it before but came across it again today. I’m putting it here for anyone else who might not have seen it. It’s a definite watch for any Mountaineer fan. Enjoy!

Tonight is the last home game of the 2005-2006 Men’s basketball season. We’re playing Pitt. It’s also going to be the last time Pittsnogle, Gansey, Herber, Collins, and Beilein play in a game at the Coliseum. People are reporting on the message boards that at 5:30am there were already students waiting in line for the game (tip off is at 7:00pm). It should be a great game. Here’s a good story about the 5 graduating seniors:
