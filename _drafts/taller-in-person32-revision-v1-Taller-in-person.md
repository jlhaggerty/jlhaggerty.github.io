I was at Dick’s Sporting Goods tonight and met [Mike Gansey](http://msnsports.net/profile.cfm?id=100839&sport=mbball) and [Patrick Beilein](http://msnsports.net/profile.cfm?id=100216&sport=mbball). They look taller in person than they do on TV, or even at the Coliseum. They are both listed as being 6’4″, I am 6’2″ and they seemed much taller than I am.

Anyway, I know you’re asking your self. What constitutes meeting some one? Well in this case it meant me saying, “Treah! Look! It’s Mike and Patrick!”. Then Treah laughed at me and made fun of me for a while. She thought I was only going to look at things to get closer to them. I wasn’t. Then when it came time to leave they were by the doors. I said hey to the 2 of them and told them they had a great game Sunday and congratulated them on the season. They both said “Thanks.” Mike said, “You know, we really couldn’t have done it with out that guy sitting in section 12, row M, seat 6.” I was surprised he knew my exact seat. OK so I made that last part up. But they did say hey and thanked me for my comments.

Now if that isn’t considered meeting two semi-famous, soon to be pro basketball players (Patrick in Europe and Mike in the NBA), I don’t know what is.
