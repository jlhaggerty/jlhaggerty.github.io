I think we all know Bush’s stance on setting a deadline in Iraq. If not here’s a recent quote:

> “I believe artificial timetables of withdrawal would be a mistake. … I will strongly reject an artificial timetable withdrawal and/or Washington politicians trying to tell those who wear the uniform how to do their job.”  
> George W. Bush, [4/23/07](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070423-2.html).

Let’s rewind to 1999, when Dubya was criticizing President Clinton on Kosovo:

> “Victory means exit strategy, and it’s important for the president to explain to us what the exit strategy is.”  
> George W. Bush, [4/9/99](http://thinkprogress.org/bush-in-1999/)

> “I think it’s also important for the president to lay out a timetable as to how long they will be involved and when they will be withdrawn.”  
> George W. Bush, [6/5/99](http://thinkprogress.org/bush-in-1999/).
