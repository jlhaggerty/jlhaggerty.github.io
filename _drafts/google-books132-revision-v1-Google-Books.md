Today I was looking up information for [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/). A google search brought me to [Google Books](http://books.google.com/). It is pretty cool. you search for a subject and it brings back all the books they have on it. Some of them have a limited preview of the book, others have the full text. Once you click on a book you just flip through the pages like you would on a normal book. You can also have google search the book for you.

[Here’s the O’Reilly Spam Assassin Book](http://books.google.com/books?id=gQQGZhXSgwIC&printsec=frontcover).
