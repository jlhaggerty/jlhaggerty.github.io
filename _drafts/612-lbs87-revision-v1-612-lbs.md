<center>![Good Eatin'](https://justin.thehaggertys.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/raw_prime.jpg)</center>The [Michigan football team](http://www.mgoblue.com/schedule.cfm?section_id=259&top=2&level=3) went [Lawry’s Restaurant](http://www.lawrysonline.com/theprimerib_beverlyhills_gen_info.asp) in Beverly Hills last night. They managed to eat 612 lbs of beef! Even there 215 lb kicker ate 3 lbs of prime rib. Apparently this is a tradition for the [Rose Bowl](http://tournamentofroses.com/rosebowlgame/index.asp). The 2 teams get to go to this restaurant and eat as much as they can. It is called the “Beef Bowl.” History has shown that the team that eats the most wins the Rose Bowl 70% of the time.

USC gets there shot at the “Beef Bowl” tonight. I think Michigan has set the bar high.
