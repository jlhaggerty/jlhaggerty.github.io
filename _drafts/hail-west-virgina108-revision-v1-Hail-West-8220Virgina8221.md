WVU won the NIT last night. However, I think Clemson got the last laugh. Check out the spelling of West Virginia on the t-shirts the NIT gave our boys after winning the game. Oops!

\*\*\* EDIT \*\*\*  
Treah pointed out that there was now an article on foxsports.com about this, and a great photo:

\*\*\* EDIT AGAIN \*\*\*  
CNN / Sports Illustrated has now picked up the story. I hope WVU gets an apology soon. Iâ€™ve seen more stories about the t-shirts than I have seen about us winning the game.
