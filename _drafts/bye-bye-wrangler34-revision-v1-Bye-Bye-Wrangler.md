Treah’s Jeep Wrangler had been having some electrical problems and just wasn’t running that great in general. Since we recently paid off the loan on my Jeep Liberty we decided that it was time to get rid of her Wrangler before it got any worse.

So last Thursday we decided it was time to start thinking of getting something else. We decided that we wanted a smaller car that got good gas mileage. We also wanted something that would be under warranty for as long as we had it. Treah will be done with school and residency in about 4 years from now. Our financial situation will be drastically different then. So we really only wanted something that would last 4 or 5 years. We thought that since we already have my jeep with high clearance and 4 wheel drive, that in bad weather we could car pool.

We got online and looked at what Ford, Mazda, and Chevy were offering. They all only offered 3 year/36,000 mile warranties. I didn’t want another Chrysler, dodge, or jeep as they have a real problem with gas mileage. We ended up looking at Hyundai. They offered a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, and a 10 year/100,000 power train warranty.

So we went up to the Hyundai dealer. We weren’t going to buy one that night so we took my jeep. We ended up test driving a [2006 Hyundai Elantra](http://www.hyundaiusa.com/vehicle/elantra/gallery/360view.aspx). One thing lead to another and we were inside talking numbers. They offered us a great trade in price on the wrangler with out seeing it. We made a deal with the dealer that we would bring in the wrangler Friday afternoon around 5:00. He even let us keep the car over night.

We got home and realized that the soft top and the title were both in Beckley with Doug and Susan. We decided that we would meet them in Flatwoods, WV on Saturday morning. Flatwoods is about 1/2 way between Morgantown and Beckley.

I left work 2 hours early on Friday to come home and finish getting things ready with the wrangler . Treah was supposed to be on call at the hospital on Friday until after the dealer was closed. The deal we had done with the dealer was that I was going to go in and sign all of the paper work that I could on Friday, then Saturday Treah would come in and finish signing her forms. Luckily, her senior resident let her out at 4:00.

We went up to the dealer to sign the papers on our loan and all of that. Also, Treah decided that she wanted the car in Navy Blue in stead of silver. After an hour or so of going back and forth with the business manager over our loan we were the owners of a 2006 Hyundai Elantra.

Treah took some pictures and posted them over on our gallery. Here’s a link to the album:
