You’ve seen my blog and now you’re asking yourself, “Who is this guy?” Well I’ve put up this page in hopes to answer that question.

I’m a male in my late 20’s. I live in [Morgantown, WV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown,_West_Virginia). I am married to [Treah](http://www.treah.com/). We have a dog named [Vandy](http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v652/227/44/25814338/n25814338_38431562_5431.jpg).

I have two degrees from [WVU](http://www.wvu.edu/). I have a BS in [Management Information Systems](http://be.wvu.edu/mis/index.htm) from the [College of Business and Economics](http://www.be.wvu.edu/) and a MS in [Software Engineering](http://www.lcsee.cemr.wvu.edu/grad/degree-info.php?degree=msse) from the [College of Engineering and Mineral Resources](http://cemr.wvu.edu/). I am also a graduate of [Spartanburg High School](http://shs.spartanburg7.org/home.aspx) in [Spartanburg, SC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartanburg,_South_Carolina).

I am a [UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) administrator. I deal mainly with [Solaris](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/10/index.jsp), [AIX](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/about.html), [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu), and [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/techspecs/). I don’t do windows. The computers I work on range in size from a pizza box to the size of several refrigerators.

I have lived all over the eastern United States, from Texas to Vermont. Check out the [map of places I’ve lived](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105317398835405214262.00000111d393035a5b35d&ll=36.991022,-84.89099&spn=14.946701,26.897178).

My hobbies include:

- NCAA Football and Basketball, especially WVU.
- Home theater
- Music
- Computers
- Networking

I think that should give you a good idea of who I am. I’m sure that I will think of more. So check back and see if I’ve updated the page.
