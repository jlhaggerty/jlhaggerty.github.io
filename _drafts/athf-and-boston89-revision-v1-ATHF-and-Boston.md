By now I’m sure all of you have heard about the viral marketing campaign the TV show [Aqua Teen Hunger Force (ATHF)](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/athf/) did in Boston this week. If not, here’s a link to a news story about it: <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16902707/>

The creators of the show and the ones behind the “scare” in Boston decided to hold a press conference after they were released. It is one of the funniest press conferences I have ever seen. Thanks to the internet, and youtube, I can share it with all of you. Enjoy.
