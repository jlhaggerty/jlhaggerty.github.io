WVU is having a free [“e-cycling”](http://wecan.wvu.edu/wvu_e_cycling_day_april_16th) event tomorrow. They’re only asking for 1 canned food item per item you bring in. I plan on taking full advantage of this event. I just got done loading up my jeep with all of my old computer and electronics. It only took me about 2 hours to do it. Here’s the end result:

I don’t think the picture does it justice so here’s a list of what I got rid of:

- 9 desktop pc’s
- 3 CRT monitors
- 3 Printers
- 2 Stereos
- 5 Keyboards
- 2 Sets of computer speakers
- 2 Pairs of stereo speakers

Now I just have to find room to put 26 cans of food.
