Ever wonder what my cubical looks like? Well now you can know, thanks to my co-worker Byron. He built a 360 degree tripod head for his Nikon D50. We used it to take a 360 degree picture of my cubical at work. The picture is to large to embed in this post so you’ll have to click on these links to see it:

The pillar on the far right and left of the picture is actually the same pillar. You can see the Hitman and Call of Duty posters on both.

I think these turned out pretty cool. Byron also took some of our datacenter, his garage, and some other co-workers cubicals.

If you want to build your own, you can find the plans at:

We took a picture every 10 degrees. I then ran the pictures through a program called “AutoStich.” It is what puts all of the photos together into one large panoramic picture. The program is free and can be downloaded at:
