Well Christmas has come and gone. Treah and I are in Vermont spending the holidays with my family.

On Christmas Eve we went to the Inn at Essex for lunch. This was to celebrate Grampa and Grammy’s 55th wedding anniversary. We had so many people that they gave us our own room in the restaurant. Later we went to the late night church service. This was the first time I have been back to our church since our old minister retired. It was kind of strange to see some one else giving the sermon. The service was nice. Lots of music. Uncle Bill sang his traditional solo of Oh Holy Night. The men’s choir also sang a few songs. Most of the classic Christmas songs were covered either by the congregation or by one of the groups performing.

After church we came home and opened presents with my parents and brother. This has become sort of a tradition to open presents from my immediate family at mid night when we get home from church. We’ve been doing it since we moved back to Vermont (about 5 or 6 years).

Christmas morning Santa had come and dropped off our stockings. We got up and opened those. Mom and Treah made prime rib and the fixings for lunch. Then we went to my grand parent’s house for presents with the rest of the family and to eat Christmas dinner.

I racked up some more great presents this week:

- Remote starter for my jeep
- Best Buy gift card
- Napoleon Dynamite t-shirt
- Drum sticks
- The Office – Season 1 DVD (NBC version)
- Clay poker chip set
- Van Heusen coat
- Quesadilla maker
- Drunk Chicken Rack
- 2 more disc golf discs
- Movie theater gift card
- Cash
- A new hammer
- Leatherman Micro

I think that’s it. I’ll update the list if I forgot anything. Thanks to everyone for the great gifts.

Tomorrow I’m going to be spending most of the day at my grand parent’s house. They want me to put in DSL, setup a small network, install a new hard drive, and teach them how to use there new digital camera. Treah is leaving tomorrow to spend a few days in NY visiting some family. I think that’s it. Sorry for such a long post.
