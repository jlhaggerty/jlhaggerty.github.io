You’ve seen my blog and now you’re asking yourself, “Who is this guy?” Well I’ve put up this page in hopes to answer that question.

I’m a male in my late 20’s. I live in Northern West Virginia. I am married to Treah. We have a dog named Vandy.

I have two degrees from WVU. I have a BS in Management Information Systems from the College of Business and Economics and a MS in Software Engineering from the College of Engineering and Mineral Resources. I am also a graduate of Spartanburg High School in Spartanburg, SC.

I am a UNIX administrator. I deal mainly with Solaris, AIX, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and OS X. I don’t do windows. The computers I work on range in size from a pizza box to the size of several refrigerators.

I have lived all over the eastern United States, from Texas to Vermont. Check out my map of places I’ve lived.

My hobbies include:

- NCAA Football and Basketball, especially WVU.
- Home theater
- Music
- Computers
- Networking

I think that should give you a good idea of who I am. I’m sure that I will think of more. So check back and see if I’ve updated the page.
