WVU is headed to the Sweet 16. We play Texas next. We lost to them by 1 point earlier this season when they were ranked 2nd in the nation. We really beat our self in that game. We had 2 chances to win the game, but missed 3 free throws in a row to end the game. We’ve got a chip on our shoulder and have something to prove, I think we play better that way.

Here’s a clip I downloaded off of my Tivo from today’s game. Nichols hits a 3 pointer from behind the 1/2 court line to end the first half.
