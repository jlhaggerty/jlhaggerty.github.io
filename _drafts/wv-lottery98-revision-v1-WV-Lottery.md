Over the last year or so, the [WV State Lottery](http://www.state.wv.us/lottery/) has started to show more and more tv commercials. All of them are cheesy and horribly done. Last night I was skipping through commercials and saw [Patrick Beilein](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/player/profile?playerId=12269). I decided to rewind to see what he was doing. I was disappointed to see two former Mountaineer greats in the commercial. It stars Patrick and [Mike Gansey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gansey). In the commercial the two of them decide to play basketball for 4 scratch off lottery tickets. The commercial is so bad, itâ€™s funny. Enjoy.
