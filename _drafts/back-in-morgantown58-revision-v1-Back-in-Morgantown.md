We made the trip back from Williston today. We left just before 7:00am this morning, and made it back to our house around 6:00pm. We made good time considering the heavy rain we hit in Pennsylvania and Maryland. We only made a couple quick stops for bathroom breaks and gas. We hit drive threws for breakfast and lunch and ate on the road.

The kennel is only open from 6:00pm-7:00pm on Sundays. We didn’t think we’d be back in time to pick Vandy up. However, we made such good time that we were able to get her tonight instead of tomorrow morning. That made Treah happy.

I had a great time this week, but it feels good to be home. I can’t wait to sleep in a bed tonight where my feet won’t be hanging off the end.

Speaking of that, I’m off to bed. Work comes early tomorrow =(
