So a new USA Today/Gallup Poll came out today ranking Bush and others in Washington. I’m not surprised to announce that people don’t seem to like the job Bush and the GOP are doing. Only 34% thinks that W is doing a good job, 71% feel he isn’t handling the energy/oil situation correctly.

Hopefully, these polls are an indication as to what is to come with the election. Here’s hoping the Dem’s take control of the house and senate. You can view the poll results at:
