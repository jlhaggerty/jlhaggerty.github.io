WVU’s first regular season men’s basketball game is tomorrow. There are a lot of new faces in this year’s line up. 9 new guys, 8 of them are freshman.

To help everyone out I ripped this basketball preview from last week’s [Mountaineer Magazine](http://www.msnsports.net/page.cfm?section=1101). It does a good job introducing the new faces.

Look for [Joe Alexander](http://www.msnsports.net/profile.cfm?id=101103&sport=mbball) to be our stand out player this year. In [last week’s exhibition](http://www.msnsports.net/content/mbbox11506.pdf), he led the team with 17 points, hit 3 of 6 three pointers, 4 defensive rebounds, and 3 offensive rebounds. Not bad for his 1st collegiate start.
