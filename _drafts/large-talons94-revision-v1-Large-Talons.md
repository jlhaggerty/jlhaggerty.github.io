A little over a year ago, WVU retired Jerry West’s number 44. There was a big ceremony at last season’s WVU vs LSU game. He came to the game and was honored at half time. At the time he was the general manager for the NBA team The Grizzlies. The owner of The Grizzlies donated money to WVU to have a bronze statue of Jerry made.

Well the statue is finally finished. It was put into place last week, and dedicated at the WVU vs Seton Hall game this weekend.

I heard it was in place on Thursday. So after work I told Treah I wanted to go take pictures of it. I even asked her to take a [picture of me with the statue](http://gallery.thehaggertys.net/main.php?g2_itemId=7997). If you know me well, you know what a quantum leap that is.

Anyway, I must say that the statue looks great. The artist went into great detail. He even shows the warn down treads on the soles of Jerry’s shoes.

When we got home I downloaded this pictures. This one stood out to me.

I couldn’t believe how long his fingers were. I showed it to Treah, and in my best [Napoleon Dynamite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q18Rx-1Xpkg) voice asked, “Does Jerry West have large talons?” She laughed and told me not to blog about that. So here I am. Enjoy the talons picture.
