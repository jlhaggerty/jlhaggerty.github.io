This company in Cincinnati is requiring employees that need access to there data center to have an RFID chip injected into there bicep. I hope this doesn’t become a widespread practice. I think if WVU ever started this I’d be looking for a new job. I don’t mind having to carry a card with an RFID chip on it, but having one implanted in me takes it to far. If I were to ever leave the company I could just give them the card back, but this chip in my arm would be with me forever.

Scary!
