There is an article today in Reuters about how much the month of March costs employers. A research company claims that about $3,800,000,000 is lost because of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. They claim that productivity is lost because of employees watching, listening, talking, and/or reading about or to the games.

Let’s break that $3.8 billion number down a bit. There are 18 days in this year’s tournament (March 16-April 3), 8 hours in a typical workday, and 60 minutes in each hour. The number of US citizens between the age of 15 and 64 is roughly 198,141,869 ([via CIA World Fact Book](http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html)), and the current unemployment rate is 5.1% ([also via CIA World Fact Book](http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2129.html)).  
`<br></br>$3,800,000,000 / 18 = $211,111,111 per day<br></br>$211,111,111 / 8 = $26,388,888 per hour<br></br>$26,388,888 / 60 = $439,814 per minute`

198,141,869 \* 5.1% = 10,105,235 unemployed people  
198,141,869 - 10,105,235 = 188,036,634 employed people in the US

$439,814 / 188,036,634 = $0.00233898039 lost per minute per working employee in the US

I’ve spent about 20 minutes writing this post and researching my numbers, and I am at work. So I guess I just wasted $0.04677960785. I hope you guys like this 5 cent blog entry.
