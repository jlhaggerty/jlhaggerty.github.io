Hereâ€™s a commercial that coke and CBS sports shot featuring two WVU fans (Nick and John). The cool thing is that I know these guys. They come to our tailgate every once in a while during football season. They are pretty good friends with some of my other friends. They definitely are the 2 biggest WVU fans that I know. John said that CBS contacted the WVU ticket office wanting to know 2 people that would be good for the commercial. The ticket office told CBS about them. Pretty cool.
