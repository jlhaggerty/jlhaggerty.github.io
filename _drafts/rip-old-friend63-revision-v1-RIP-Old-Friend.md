Well I finally did it. I bought a new hat. I don’t do this all that often. So to me its like the changing of the guards. I think my old hat was about 5 years old. My parents, grandparents, and wife have been begging me to replace it for about 3 years now. My thought was that it was just starting to get warn in.

I decided this weekend that it was time for a new one. I was wearing it and couldn’t figure out what smelled so bad. I quickly realized it was coming from my hat. 5 years of sweat was starting to take it’s toll. Luckily, Treah said she couldn’t smell it yet.

This hat has been through a lot. I have warn it almost everyday at one point or another. In the last 5 years it has seen:

- Me get Married
- Me and Treah graduate from WVU, then start again
- Me have 5 positions at work, all while working for the same place
- My brother graduate, twice
- Dad turning 50
- Mom and Dad’s 25th Anniversary
- Moves to and/or from 2 apartments, and 1 house
- Getting a dog
- WVU Men’s Basketball Team make it to the elite 8, then to the sweet 16
- WVU Football go to 4 bowl games, including a win in a BCS bowl
- I’m sure there is more to add to the list, I’ll add them as I remember or as people comment

If the football or basketball team starts to suck, I’m switching back to my old hat.
