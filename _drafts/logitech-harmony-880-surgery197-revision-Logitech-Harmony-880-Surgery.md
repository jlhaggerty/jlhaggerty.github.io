I have had a Logitech Harmony 880 universal remote for about 2 years now. Nothing beats being able to push a single button and have the remote turn on the tv, put it on the right input, change the stereo, and power on the appropriate component. This feature alone might have saved my marriage.

This being said, the construction of the remote leaves much to be desired. I’m on my second remote. I had to RMA the first, luckily it was under warranty. The replacement remote I was sent is now out of warranty.

Since going off warranty this remote has had several problems. The first problem was that the remote would no longer charge. It turned out that the problem was that the battery wasn’t keeping a good connection. This was a relatively easy fix. I just had to clean the contacts with rubbing alcohol, and wedged a folded up business card between the battery and the edge of the battery compartment.

The second problem developed over the course of several months. The channel up and volume up buttons stopped working.
