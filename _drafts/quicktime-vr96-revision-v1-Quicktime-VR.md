After [my last post](https://justin.thehaggertys.net/?p=95), I started wondering how people made those Quicktime VR movies. I found a couple utilities, but they all required Mac OS 9. I’ve got Mac OS X, and don’t have the classic support turned on (or what ever they call it officially). Anyway I came across [Apple’s Quicktime tools page](http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/), and found the program that does it in OS X. It’s called [QTVR Make Cubic](ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Quicktime/Tools/QTVR/MakeCubic_v1.1.6.sit). Sorry Windows folks, this is a Mac only program.

Any way here is a Quicktime VR movie of my cubical. Click and drag your mouse on the image. To zoom in and out use the shift and ctrl keys. [Click Here to view](https://justin.thehaggertys.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/cubical.mov).
