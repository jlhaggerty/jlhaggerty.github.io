You’ve seen my blog and now you’re asking yourself, “Who is this guy?” Well I’ve put up this page in hopes to answer that question.

I’m a male in my late 20’s. I live in Morgantown, West Virginia. I am married to [Treah](http://www.treah.com/). We have a dog named [Vandy](http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v652/227/44/25814338/n25814338_38431562_5431.jpg).

I have two degrees from [WVU](http://www.wvu.edu/). I have a BS in [Management Information Systems](http://be.wvu.edu/mis/index.htm) from the [College of Business and Economics](http://www.be.wvu.edu/) and a MS in [Software Engineering from](http://www.lcsee.cemr.wvu.edu/grad/degree-info.php?degree=msse) the [College of Engineering and Mineral Resources. I am also a graduate of Spartanburg High School in Spartanburg, SC.](http://cemr.wvu.edu/)

I am a UNIX administrator. I deal mainly with Solaris, AIX, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and OS X. I don’t do windows. The computers I work on range in size from a pizza box to the size of several refrigerators.

I have lived all over the eastern United States, from Texas to Vermont. Check out my map of places I’ve lived.

My hobbies include:

- NCAA Football and Basketball, especially WVU.
- Home theater
- Music
- Computers
- Networking

I think that should give you a good idea of who I am. I’m sure that I will think of more. So check back and see if I’ve updated the page.
