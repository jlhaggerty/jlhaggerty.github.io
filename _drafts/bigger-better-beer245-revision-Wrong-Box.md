Treah and I went to Pittsburgh today. On the way home I decided to stop at a beer distributor and pick up a case of [Yuengling](http://www.yuengling.com) for our tailgate next weekend. You can’t buy Yuengling in WV, so it’s always a treat to get.

When I got home I realized my mistake. I bought a case of twelve 32 ounce bottles. Oops.

Comparison shot. Normal 12 ounce beer and a 32 ounce Yuengling.
